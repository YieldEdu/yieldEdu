						Our Mission

					<p className="mb-4">
						YieldEdu Protocol was founded with a simple yet powerful mission: to
						make DeFi education accessible, rewarding, and directly connected to
						real-world applications. We believe that the best way to learn is by
						doing, and the best incentive for learning is earning real rewards.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our learn-to-earn model bridges the gap between theoretical
						knowledge, practical experience and rewards, allowing students to
						gain valuable insights while educators earn for sharing their
						expertise.

						Our Story
					</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						YieldEdu was formally YieldStake and was conceived in 2024 by
						Kamasah Dickson who saw a critical gap in the market: plenty of
						educational resources existed for blockchain and DeFi, but few
						connected learning directly to earning opportunities.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Determined to change this, we launched YieldEdu in 2024, combining
						interactive learning, staking opportunities, and on-chain
						incentives. Our approach quickly gained traction, and in 2025, we
						placed 4th in the DeFi category at the{" "}

						</a>{" "}
						Semester 2 Hackathon, validating our vision of bridging education
						with real financial opportunities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since then, we have helped thousands of students understand DeFi
						concepts while earning tangible rewards and pioneered new ways for
						educators to monetize their knowledge.
