## üîß Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- pnpm
- Git
- EDU testnet wallet
- IDE (VS Code recommended)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YieldEdu/yieldEdu.git
cd YieldEdu
```

1. **Install dependencies for hardhat**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install smartcontract dependencies
cd solidity
pnpm install
```

1. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
cd solidty

npx hardhat vars set ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY
# Enter your wallet's private key when prompted
```

1. **Compile Smart Contracts**

```bash
npx hardhat compile

# //it has already been deploy so there is no need. you can skip this step
npx hardhat deploy
```

1. **Run Tests**

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

```bash
# Run all tests with gas reporting

REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Run coverage to see test coverages
npx hardhat coverage
```

1. **Start Frontend Development Server**

```bash
# In the frontend directory
cd into root or frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

1. **Access the Application**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Web3**: Reown AppKit, wagmi, viem
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat
- **Testing**: Hardhat, Chai

## üìà Local Development

1. **Start Local Hardhat Node**

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

1. **Deploy Contracts Locally**

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/YieldPool.ts --['your network']
```

1. **Configure Frontend**

- Update contract addresses in `frontend/lib/utils.ts`
- Ensure your wallet is connected to localhost network or your preferred network.

1. **Handling Metamask Errors**
   Metamask currently has a bug so sometimes transactions will fail in cases like minting and switching addresses. This is because metamask tracks blocks which is not in sync with the local network and will sometimes throw errors like Internal JSON-RPC Error. to fix these errors

1. **Handling Connection Errors**
   sometimes connections to your metamask will not be detected. This is a reown library problem. to resolve this issue,

- Click on your metamask
- Click on the green dot on the top-right beside your options menu
- Disconnect and try again connecting on th site.

- Click on Metamask and go to settings
- Click on Advanced
- Click on Clear Activity Tab Data
- Click on Clear

NOTE: to switch your account address you must do that in you metamask wallet.

## Getting Started Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
